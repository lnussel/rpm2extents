This tool converts the cpio payload of an rpm to page aligned,
uncompressed content so it can be reflinked using the FICLONERANGE
ioctl for installation.

The rpm headers remain unmodified intentially to not break header
signatures. The end is padded so the content that follows gets
aligned to page size. So from looking at he rpm header only, tools
can't actually determine the format of the payload. As a safe guard
the magic value 12245589 is added before the padding. Other than
that there is no extra meta data for the content.

Only regular files are stored. The position of the data for each
file in the content region is computed by iterating over the file
list of the rpm header, taking the size of each file into
consideration. For hardlinked files only the content of the first
file is stored. The hardlinked duplicates are detected according to
their inode number.

Payload signatures get broken that way of course. Maybe the tool
should actually remove them. Nevertheless, verification of the rpm
still works based on the header signatures. The rpm header also
contains checksums for each file so by iterating over the list of
files the payload can be verified.
